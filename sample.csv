REAL,The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress  who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts  called himself a  fiscal conservative  on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans  U.S. Representative Mark Meadows  speaking on CBS   Face the Nation   drew a hard line on federal spending  which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday  lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues  such as immigration policy  even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending  while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense  discretionary  spending on programs that support education  scientific research  infrastructure  public health and environmental protection.  The  Trump  administration has already been willing to say   We re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent    Meadows  chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus  said on the program.  Now  Democrats are saying that s not enough  we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative  I don t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people s money   he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party s debt-financed tax overhaul  which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt.  It s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility   Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion  to be paid off by future generations  to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich.  This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we re going to be paying for this for many  many years to come   Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package  the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years   will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan  who also supported the tax bill  recently went further than Meadows  making clear in a radio interview that welfare or  entitlement reform   as the party often calls it  would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance   entitlement  programs mean food stamps  housing assistance  Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly  poor and disabled  as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan s early December remarks  saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate  where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate  which Republicans narrowly control  to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending  while tackling the issue of the  Dreamers   people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  or DACA  program  which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives  such as wall funding.  We need to do DACA clean   she said.  On Wednesday  Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7  the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott  who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida  Texas and Puerto Rico  and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.   
REAL,Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts  the Pentagon said on Friday  after President Donald Trump s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts  one in Washington and one in Virginia  last week rejected the administration s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings.  The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs  the administration has decided to wait for DOD s study and will continue to defend the president s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime   the official said  speaking on condition of anonymity. In September  the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court  but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement   As mandated by court order  the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.  Jennifer Levi  a lawyer with gay  lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD  called the decision not to appeal  great news.   I m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it s not good for the military or our country   Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters  Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military  reversing Democratic President Barack Obama s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military  cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.  Four federal judges - in Baltimore  Washington  D.C.  Seattle and Riverside  California - have issued rulings blocking Trump s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants  sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept  some individuals who are not medically fit for service.  The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1  2017  to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump s defense secretary  James Mattis  postponed that date to Jan. 1  2018  which the president s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October  his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees  reversing another Obama-era position. In February  Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.   
REAL,The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018  despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down  a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham  who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees  said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference.  This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence   Graham said on CBS s Face the Nation news program.  And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he s the right guy at the right time.   The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election  and how Trump s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort  has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power  despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was  going to be fair.     Russia s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating  as well as Mueller  whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI . Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign  and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy  Christopher Steele  which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller s inquiry.   On Saturday  the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe  but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.   I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it  and I want somebody to look at it   Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue.  As a matter of fact  it would hurt us if we ignored it   he said.   
REAL,Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that Russia had political dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton  the New York Times reported on Saturday. The conversation between Papadopoulos and the diplomat  Alexander Downer  in London was a driving factor behind the FBI s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of Moscow s contacts with the Trump campaign  the Times reported. Two months after the meeting  Australian officials passed the information that came from Papadopoulos to their American counterparts when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online  according to the newspaper  which cited four current and former U.S. and foreign officials. Besides the information from the Australians  the probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments  including the British and Dutch  the Times said. Papadopoulos  a Chicago-based international energy lawyer  pleaded guilty on Oct. 30 to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials. It was the first criminal charge alleging links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House has played down the former aide s campaign role  saying it was  extremely limited  and that any actions he took would have been on his own. The New York Times  however  reported that Papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and edited the outline of Trump s first major foreign policy speech in April 2016. The federal investigation  which is now being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller  has hung over Trump s White House since he took office almost a year ago. Some Trump allies have recently accused Mueller s team of being biased against the Republican president. Lawyers for Papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by Reuters for comment. Mueller s office declined to comment. Trump s White House attorney  Ty Cobb  declined to comment on the New York Times report.  Out of respect for the special counsel and his process  we are not commenting on matters such as this   he said in a statement. Mueller has charged four Trump associates  including Papadopoulos  in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow.   
REAL,President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge  much more  to ship packages for Amazon  AMZN.O   picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.      Why is the United States Post Office  which is losing many billions of dollars a year  while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages  making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!  Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service  which runs at a big loss  is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses  according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission  an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos  who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world  according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post  a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year  Trump has said the  Amazon Washington Post  fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax  which is not true  and so hurts other retailers  part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives  a research analyst at GBH Insights  said Trump s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However  he said he was not concerned for Amazon.  We do not see any price hikes in the future. However  that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and  it  is building out its distribution  system  aggressively   he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service  including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015  the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping  46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1 175.90 by early afternoon. Overall  U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel  president of ShipMatrix Inc  which analyzes shipping data  disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc  UPS.N  and FedEx Corp  FDX.N   the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services  he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages  for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season  Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys  from post offices to customers  doorsteps. Amazon s No. 2 carrier is UPS  at 21 percent  and FedEx is third  with 8 percent or so  according to Jindel. Trump s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce  which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut  a spokesman for UPS  noted that the company values its  productive relationship  with the postal service  but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon  the White House  the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump s tweet. According to its annual report  the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year  and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service s revenue for first class mail  marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining  revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30  2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February  the service is facing growing personnel expenses  particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law  the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue.   
REAL,The White House said on Friday it was set to kick off talks next week with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders on immigration policy  government spending and other issues that need to be wrapped up early in the new year. The expected flurry of legislative activity comes as Republicans and Democrats begin to set the stage for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trump s Republican Party is eager to maintain control of Congress while Democrats look for openings to wrest seats away in the Senate and the House of Representatives. On Wednesday  Trump s budget chief Mick Mulvaney and legislative affairs director Marc Short will meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan - both Republicans - and their Democratic counterparts  Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi  the White House said. That will be followed up with a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump  McConnell and Ryan on Jan. 6 and 7 at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland  according to the White House. The Senate returns to work on Jan. 3 and the House on Jan. 8. Congress passed a short-term government funding bill last week before taking its Christmas break  but needs to come to an agreement on defense spending and various domestic programs by Jan. 19  or the government will shut down. Also on the agenda for lawmakers is disaster aid for people hit by hurricanes in Puerto Rico  Texas and Florida  and by wildfires in California. The House passed an $81 billion package in December  which the Senate did not take up. The White House has asked for a smaller figure  $44 billion. Deadlines also loom for soon-to-expire protections for young adult immigrants who entered the country illegally as children  known as  Dreamers.  In September  Trump ended Democratic former President Barack Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  DACA  program  which protected Dreamers from deportation and provided work permits  effective in March  giving Congress until then to devise a long-term solution. Democrats  some Republicans and a number of large companies have pushed for DACA protections to continue. Trump and other Republicans have said that will not happen without Congress approving broader immigration policy changes and tougher border security. Democrats oppose funding for a wall promised by Trump along the U.S.-Mexican border.   The Democrats have been told  and fully understand  that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration   ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc   Trump said in a Twitter post on Friday. Trump wants to overhaul immigration rules for extended families and others seeking to live in the United States. Republican U.S. Senator Jeff Flake  a frequent critic of the president  said he would work with Trump to protect Dreamers.  We can fix DACA in a way that beefs up border security  stops chain migration for the DREAMers  and addresses the unfairness of the diversity lottery. If POTUS  Trump  wants to protect these kids  we want to help him keep that promise   Flake wrote on Twitter. Congress in early 2018 also must raise the U.S. debt ceiling to avoid a government default. The U.S. Treasury would exhaust all of its borrowing options and run dry of cash to pay its bills by late March or early April if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling before then  according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Trump  who won his first major legislative victory with the passage of a major tax overhaul this month  has also promised a major infrastructure plan.   
REAL,President Donald Trump said on Thursday he believes he will be fairly treated in a special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election  but said he did not know how long the probe would last. The federal investigation has hung over Trump s White House since he took office almost a year ago  and some Trump allies have in recent weeks accused the team of Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller of being biased against the Republican president. But in an interview with the New York Times  Trump appeared to shrug off concerns about the investigation  which was prompted by U.S. intelligence agencies  conclusion that Russia tried to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda.  There s been no collusion. But I think he s going to be fair   Trump said in what the Times described as a 30-minute impromptu interview at his golf club in West Palm Beach  Florida. Mueller has charged four Trump associates in his investigation. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election. U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said this month that he was not aware of any impropriety by Mueller s team. Trump s lawyers have been saying for weeks that they had expected the Mueller investigation to wrap up quickly  possibly by the end of 2017. Mueller has not commented on how long it will last. Trump told the Times that he did not know how long the investigation would take.  Timing-wise  I can t tell you. I just don t know   he said. Trump said he thought a prolonged probe  makes the country look bad  but said it has energized his core supporters.  What it s done is  it s really angered the base and made the base stronger. My base is strong than it s ever been   he said. The interview was a rare break in Trump s Christmas vacation in Florida. He has golfed each day aside from Christmas Day  and mainly kept a low profile  apart from the occasional flurry of tweets. He spent one day golfing with Republican Senator David Perdue from Georgia  who has pushed legislation to cap immigration numbers  and had dinner on Thursday with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross  an international trade hawk. Trump told the Times he hoped to work with Democrats in the U.S. Congress on a spending plan to fix roads and other infrastructure  and on protections for a group of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Trump spoke about trade issues  saying he had backed off his hard line on Chinese trade practices in the hope that Beijing would do more to pressure North Korea to end its nuclear and missile testing program. He said he had been disappointed in the results. He also complained about the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   which his administration is attempting to renegotiate in talks with Mexico and Canada. Trump said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had played down the importance of Canadian oil and lumber exports to the United States when looking at the balance of trade between the two countries.  If I don t make the right deal  I ll terminate NAFTA in two seconds. But we re doing pretty good   Trump said.

REAL,Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill said he will certify Democratic Senator-elect Doug Jones as winner on Thursday despite opponent Roy Moore s challenge  in a phone call on CNN. Moore  a conservative who had faced allegations of groping teenage girls when he was in his 30s  filed a court challenge late on Wednesday to the outcome of a U.S. Senate election he unexpectedly lost.   
REAL,Alabama officials on Thursday certified Democrat Doug Jones the winner of the state s U.S. Senate race  after a state judge denied a challenge by Republican Roy Moore  whose campaign was derailed by accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. Jones won the vacant seat by about 22 000 votes  or 1.6 percentage points  election officials said. That made him the first Democrat in a quarter of a century to win a Senate seat in Alabama.  The seat was previously held by Republican Jeff Sessions  who was tapped by U.S. President Donald Trump as attorney general. A state canvassing board composed of Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill  Governor Kay Ivey and Attorney General Steve Marshall certified the election results. Seating Jones will narrow the Republican majority in the Senate to 51 of 100 seats. In a statement  Jones called his victory  a new chapter  and pledged to work with both parties. Moore declined to concede defeat even after Trump urged him to do so. He stood by claims of a fraudulent election in a statement released after the certification and said he had no regrets  media outlets reported. An Alabama judge denied Moore s request to block certification of the results of the Dec. 12 election in a decision shortly before the canvassing board met. Moore s challenge alleged there had been potential voter fraud that denied him a chance of victory. His filing on Wednesday in the Montgomery Circuit Court sought to halt the meeting scheduled to ratify Jones  win on Thursday. Moore could ask for a recount  in addition to possible other court challenges  Merrill said in an interview with Fox News Channel. He would have to complete paperwork  within a timed period  and show he has the money for a challenge  Merrill said.  We ve not been notified yet of their intention to do that   Merrill said. Regarding the claim of voter fraud  Merrill told CNN that more than 100 cases had been reported.  We ve adjudicated more than 60 of those. We will continue to do that   he said.  Republican lawmakers in Washington had distanced themselves from Moore and called for him to drop out of the race after several women accused him of sexual assault or misconduct dating back to when they were teenagers and he was in his early 30s.  Moore has denied wrongdoing and Reuters has not been able to independently verify the allegations.   
REAL,The new U.S. tax code targets high-tax states and may be unconstitutional  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday  saying that the bill may violate New York residents  rights to due process and equal protection.  The sweeping Republican tax bill signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday introduces a cap  of $10 000   on deductions of state and local income and property taxes  known as SALT. The tax overhaul was the party s first major legislative victory since Trump took office in January.  The SALT provision will hit many taxpayers in states with high incomes  high property values and high taxes  like New York  New Jersey and California. Those states are generally Democratic leaning.   I m not even sure what they did is legally constitutional and that s something we re looking at now   Cuomo said in an interview with CNN. In an interview with CNBC  Cuomo suggested why the bill may be unconstitutional.   Politics does not trump the law   Cuomo said on CNBC.  You have the constitution  you have the law  you have due process  you have equal protection. You can t use politics just because the majority controls to override the law.  The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution  better known for its protection against self-incrimination  also protects individuals from seizure of life  liberty or property without due process and has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as guaranteeing equal protection by the law.  Cuomo and California Governor Jerry Brown  both Democrats  have previously said they were exploring legal challenges to SALT deduction limits.  Law professors have said legal challenges would likely rest on arguing that the provision interferes with the protection of states  rights under the U.S. Constitution s 10th Amendment. Tax attorneys said Cuomo s legal argument against the tax bill could be that it discriminates and places an unjust tax burden on states that heavily voted for Democrats in the past - known as  blue states.   The de facto effect of this legislation is to discriminate against blue states and particularly from  Cuomo s  perspective the state of New York   said Joseph Callahan  an attorney with the law firm Mackay  Caswell   Callahan in New York.  But some tax experts noted the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the 16th Amendment to give Congress broad latitude to tax as it sees fit. In a frequently cited 1934 decision  the Supreme Court called tax deductions a  legislative grace  rather than a vested right.  I don t understand how they think they have a valid lawsuit here   David Gamage  a professor of tax law at Indiana University s Maurer School of Law  told Reuters last week  speaking generally about governors in blue states that could challenge the tax bill.  Cuomo also said on Thursday that New York is proposing a restructuring of its tax code. He provided no details.  A group of 13 law professors on Dec. 18 published a paper suggesting ways that high-tax states could minimize the effects of the SALT deduction cap.  Their suggestions included shifting more of the tax burden onto businesses in the form of higher employer-side payroll taxes  since the federal tax bill s cap on SALT deductions only applies to individuals and not businesses. States also could raise taxes on pass-through entities  which the federal tax bill specifically benefits with a lower rate on a portion of their income. On Friday  Cuomo said he would allow state residents to make a partial or full pre-payment on their property tax bill before Jan. 1  allowing taxpapyers to deduct such payments for 2017 before the cap kicks in  prompting a wave of residents to pay early.  However  the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on Wednesday advised homeowners that the pre-payment of 2018 property taxes may not be deductible.

REAL,   In Dec. 25 story  in second paragraph  corrects name of Strong s employer to Mental Health Department  not Public Health Department.  By Bernie Woodall  Reuters  - A man claiming to be the person who delivered a gift-wrapped package of horse manure at the Los Angeles home of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday he did it to protest the federal tax overhaul signed into law last week by President Donald Trump. Robert Strong  45  a psychologist for the Los Angeles County Mental Health Department  said by telephone he left the poop-filled parcel addressed to Mnuchin and Trump in the driveway outside Mnuchin s home in the posh Bel Air community.  KNBC-TV  an NBC television affiliate in Los Angeles  reported Mnuchin was not home at the time. The package was found by Mnuchin s neighbor.     Protest really should be funny   Strong told Reuters.  People s eyes glaze over when they just see angry people in the streets.  He believes the new tax law will hurt poor people. Neither the U.S. Secret Service nor the Los Angeles Police Department  both of which investigated the incident  would confirm Strong was responsible. The Secret Service interviewed an individual who admitted delivering the package  but no charges had been filed against him as of Monday afternoon. LAPD Lieutenant Rob Weise said it was possible whoever left the package did not break any criminal laws. While he is not assigned to investigate the incident  Weise said if the box did not present any danger  it would not be illegal. The LAPD bomb squad X-rayed the box before opening it on Saturday. In a photo of the card Strong posted on Twitter  he wrote  Misters Mnuchin   Trump  We re returning the  gift  of the Christmas tax bill  and signed it  Warmest wishes  The American people.       Strong said a Secret Service agent  accompanied by six police officers  showed up at his house to question him on Sunday night  and the agent chided him  asking    Are you ashamed of your behavior?       The White House declined to comment on Monday and officials with the Treasury Department could not be reached.           
REAL,A lottery drawing to settle a tied Virginia legislative race that could shift the statehouse balance of power has been indefinitely postponed  state election officials said on Tuesday  after the Democratic candidate mounted a legal fight. The decision to put off the high-stakes lotto  originally scheduled for Wednesday  marks the latest twist in a dramatic election recount that at one point showed Democrat Shelly Simonds beating Republican incumbent David Yancey by a single vote.  A victory by Simonds would shift Republicans  slim control of the 100-member House of Delegates to an even 50-50 split with the Democrats  forcing the two parties into a rare power-sharing arrangement. A day after Simonds emerged as the victor of a recount  a three-judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for Yancey. That decision left the two candidates tied with 11 608 votes each in a district that encompasses the shipping hub of Newport News in southeastern Virginia  setting the stage for the equivalent of a coin toss to pick a final winner. Simonds asked a state court to reconsider on Tuesday  arguing that the disputed ballot was wrongly included. An image filed in court showed that the ballot had bubbles filled in beside both names  with a slash mark by Simonds  name. The voter selected Republicans for other offices. Simonds told reporters that the case had implications not only for her contest but for the integrity of state elections as a whole  saying that without a court ruling in her favor   recounts would become a never-ending spiral of courtroom challenges.  The chairman of the Virginia Board of Elections  James Alcorn  said in a statement that while holding a lottery would be in keeping with state law  such a move should be considered  an action of last resort.  He added   Any substantive concerns regarding the election or recount should be resolved before a random drawing is conducted.     Yancey s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Virginia House Republican Caucus said in a statement that it was reviewing the new court filings.  We believe the court acted appropriately and that the integrity of the process is without question   spokesman Parker Slaybaugh said. Virginia Department of Elections spokeswoman Andrea Gaines said in an email that no new date for a drawing has been set. Democrats notched historic gains in Virginia s statehouse elections last month  part of the party s first big wave of political victories since Republican Donald Trump won the White House last year. Before the Nov. 7 general election  Virginia Republicans held 66 seats to the Democrats  34 in the House of Delegates  along with a majority in the state Senate.   
REAL,A Georgian-American businessman who met then-Miss Universe pageant owner Donald Trump in 2013  has been questioned by congressional investigators about whether he helped organize a meeting between Russians and Trump s eldest son during the 2016 election campaign  four sources familiar with the matter said. The meeting at Trump Tower in New York involving Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign advisers is a focus of probes by Congress and Special Counsel Robert Mueller on whether campaign officials colluded with Russia when it sought to interfere in the U.S. election  the sources said. Russia denies allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that it meddled in the election and President Donald Trump denies any collusion. The Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees recently questioned behind closed doors Irakly Kaveladze  a U.S. citizen born in the former Soviet republic of Georgia  the sources said. He is a U.S.-based representative of Azerbaijani oligarch Aras Agalarov s real estate firm  the Crocus Group. The panels knew Kaveladze was at the June 9  2016 meeting but became more interested in him after learning he also attended a private dinner in Las Vegas in 2013 with Trump and Agalarov as they celebrated an agreement to hold that year s Miss Universe pageant in Moscow  the sources said.  Committee members now want to know more about the extent of Kaveladze s contacts with the Trump family and whether he had a bigger role than previously believed in setting up the Trump Tower meeting when Trump was a Republican candidate for president. The White House declined to comment. Mueller s office also declined to comment. Scott Balber  a New York lawyer who represents Kaveladze  confirmed that his client attended both the dinner in Las Vegas and the Trump Tower meeting but said he did not set up the second meeting. Trump s son-in-law Jared Kushner  other Trump campaign aides  and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya were also at that meeting. Lawyer Balber also said the committees were only seeking Kaveladze s input as a witness and were not targeting him for investigation.  No-one has ever told me that they have any interest in him other than as a witness   Balber said. Lawyers for Trump Jr. and Kushner did not respond to requests for comment about their contacts with Kaveladze. A lawyer for President Trump declined to comment. One photograph from the 2013 dinner  when Trump still owned the Miss Universe pageant  shows Agalarov and his pop singer son Emin along with Trump  two Trump aides and several other people at the dining table. Another shows Kaveladze standing behind Trump and Emin Agalarov as they speak. The pictures were found by a University of California at Irvine student and blogger Scott Stedman  who posted them on Nov. 22. Aras Agalarov is a billionaire property developer in Russia who was awarded the Order of Honor by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Several U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mueller s team and the committees are looking for any evidence of a link between the Trump Tower meeting and the release six weeks later of emails stolen from Democratic Party organizations. They are also trying to determine whether there was any discussion at the New York meeting of lifting U.S. economic sanctions on Russia  a top priority for Putin  the officials said. Rob Goldstone  a British publicist  told Trump Jr. ahead of the New York meeting that Russian lawyer Veselnitskaya would be bringing damaging information about donations to a charity linked to Trump s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton  according to emails later released by Trump Jr. Trump Jr. initially said the meeting was about Russian adoptions but later said it also included Veselnitskaya s promises of information on the donations to the Clinton charity. He said he ultimately never received the information  although it was later posted on the Internet. In a statement issued after meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 7  Trump  Jr. said Goldstone and Veselnitskaya were in a conference room with him as well as Kaveladze and a translator. Balber said Kaveladze attended expecting to serve as a translator  although he did not do so in the end because Veselnitskaya brought her own.

REAL,A U.S. appeals court in Washington on Tuesday upheld a lower court s decision to allow President Donald Trump s commission investigating voter fraud to request data on voter rolls from U.S. states. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the Electronic Privacy Information Center  EPIC  watchdog group  which filed the lawsuit  did not have legal standing to seek to force the presidential commission to review privacy concerns before collecting individuals  voter data. EPIC had argued that under federal law  the commission was required to conduct a privacy-impact assessment before gathering personal data. But the three-judge appeals court panel ruled unanimously that the privacy law at issue was intended to protect individuals  not groups like EPIC.  EPIC is not a voter   Judge Karen Henderson wrote in the ruling.  Washington-based U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly first denied EPIC s injunction request in July  in part because the collection of data by the commission was not technically an action by a government agency so was not bound by laws that govern what such entities can do.  Kollar-Kotelly noted that the commission  headed by Vice President Mike Pence  was an advisory body that lacks legal authority to compel states to hand over the data. Most state officials who oversee elections and election law experts say that voter fraud is rare in the United States. Trump  a Republican  set up the commission in May after charging  without evidence  that millions of people voted unlawfully in the 2016 presidential election in which he defeated Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton despite losing the popular vote.  The commission s vice chair  Kris Kobach  the Republican secretary of state for Kansas and an advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification  asked states in June to turn over voter information. The data requested by Kobach included names  the last four digits of Social Security numbers  addresses  birth dates  political affiliation  felony convictions and voting histories.  More than 20 states refused outright and others said they needed to study whether they could provide the data. Civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have said the commission s eventual findings could lead to new ID requirements and other measures making it harder for groups that tend to favor Democratic candidates to cast ballots. EPIC executive director Marc Rotenberg could not immediately be reached for comment.   
FAKE, Donald Trump campaign senior advisor Jack Kingston appeared on CNN Friday to discuss Trump s efforts to reach out to voters of color. During the segment  Kingston said that  maybe it would have been nice if he  Trump  went and had a backdrop with a burning car  while speaking at a campaign event in Wisconsin in order to appeal to black voters. As a reminder  you are not reading The Onion  those are the real words that Kingston said while on television for the entire world to hear.During the segment  CNN host Brianna Keiler attempted to explain to Kingston that it isn t a good idea to try and reach out to voters of color by speaking to a nearly entirely white community. She also questioned the decision to reach out to a voting bloc that overwhelmingly supports the Democratic challenger  Hillary Clinton. As per usual when talking to a Trump fan  Kingston says that Trump is doing far better with a group than polls show.Here s a transcript of the conversation Keilar  He s polling right now at 2 percent with African-American voters. Is that the right way to attract a voting block that obviously favors Hillary Clinton much more than him?Kingston  Well first of all  our internal poll show us doing better than 2 percent  but the reality is he s going there and he s taking it to them. He s giving them a proposal. He s saying   You know what? I m interested  I went to Milwaukee  I m here tonight  I want to talk to you.  And one of the things he actually said last night in North Carolina that kind of went uncovered  but he says  I don t want to preside over another generation of children who are left out of the American dream. Keilar  I have to stop you because you said he s going there. He s not  he s in Diamondale  which is 93 percent white. When he was in Milwaukee the other day  it was part of Milwaukee that wasn t dealing   I mean he  it s  Kingston  Well yeah  but Brianna he went  Keilar  It s almost completely white.Kingston  I mean  maybe it would have been nice if he went and had a backdrop with a burning car  but the reality is  Keilar  No no no no no  I m not talking about a burning car. I m talking about meeting with black voters.Kingston  Well  he met with David Clarke  who as you know is the African-American Sheriff of Milwaukee  and he s engaged with him. And his rallies are open to the public. Last night in North Carolina  we saw a lot of African-Americans. I wasn t sure about the crowd content tonight  but the reality is  Keilar  It s white. We checked.Wow. It s hard to imagine Trump s polling numbers being able to go down from a measly 2  from black voters. However  they might plummet to zero if they keep up with this pathetic voter outreach effort.You can watch the segment below  via Media Matters Featured image from video screenshot                                                                                                                                                                          
FAKE, As crunch time nears and states are having their primary contests  the Clinton campaign is wasting no time in getting further ahead than the Republicans.In a new report detailed by Politico  Hillary Clinton and her campaign are setting course to raise over $1 billion to unseat vulnerable House and Senate Republicans  with the aim of knocking off 10 to 25 House seats from Republicans and taking back the Senate.Hillary Clinton will raise $1 billion for Democrats and the party will train some of their efforts   and that money   on defeating House and Senate Republicans. Party leaders privately concede that the Senate could be lost either way. But senior House Republicans say they re in good shape across the country  and see no evidence that the control of the chamber is in playRepublicans are especially antsy at these revelations  considering the Republican National Committee fell almost $10 million short in their July fundraising predications  they only conjured up $27 million . In that same month  the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  the fundraising arm of the Democratic National Committee  raised over $35 million  not including the total $90 million in joint fundraising with Clinton   and has raised almost $20 million more than the RNC for the 2016 fiscal year so far.In contrast  Trump had a very good month for fundraising. Counter that with the RNC s pathetic monthly numbers  the money speaks for itself  the GOP is putting its trust  and money  in Trump and Trump alone.So while Trump is hurting down-ballot candidates and their efforts for re-election  Clinton is set to raise unprecedented amounts of money for the Democrats  all while having her own campaign to fund.Back in May 2015  Politico reported that Clinton s campaign sought to raise over $2 billion by the time the November general election rolled around. Considering the Clinton campaign has raised  per OpenSecrets  $375 million for her own personal campaign  $100 million in 2015 for down-ballot candidates in 2015  and over $60 million through the summer of 2016  coupled with the goal of $1 billion by November   that leaves the campaign roughly $465 million off target.Still  the Clinton machine is dominating Republicans in fundraising  not just for the presidential candidate  but for everyone else involved.Clinton is serious about getting stuff done   she knows her policies will be  pie-in-the-sky  without support from Congress. So what does she do? She raises more money for other Democrats than she does for herself. Trump  on the other hand  hoards the money for himself while he s a billionaire. See how that concentration of wealth screws everyone over  Republicans? Ironic  isn t it.Featured image Justin Sullivan Getty Images

FAKE, Republican strategists and party officials are circulating a plan of action that they are close to enacting  based on the premise that Donald Trump will almost certainly lose the presidential election. The plan is a way for congressional campaigns to untangle themselves from the Trump campaign  saving their own skins in November.Party strategists are mapping out blueprints for down-ballot candidates  in TV ads and on the campaign trail  to present themselves as checks on a Hillary Clinton presidency. It s an approach that would essentially admit a Trump loss. In interviews  nearly one dozen Republican operatives said they had begun poll-testing the idea   which one labeled a  break glass in case of emergency  strategy   to gauge how the public would react to it.The last time Republicans essentially abandoned their nominee was in 1996  when it became clear that Senator Bob Dole would lose to President Bill Clinton. Clinton went on to win that race with 379 electoral votes and victories in 31 states and Washington  D.C. But Republicans were able to stop the bleeding and held on to House and Senate seats.Politico reports that the emergency election plan involves an appeal based on telling voters that Republicans want congressional seats in order to provide a check on the power that Hillary Clinton would have as President. Infamous Republican political operative Karl Rove seems to be on board.The deliberations extend to the highest levels of the party. American Crossroads  the influential conservative group that was co-founded by Karl Rove  has tested to see how voters would feel about Republicans casting themselves as being a check and balance to Hillary Clinton  according to four sources familiar with the deliberations.The existence of this plan  and the fact that so much of it is already mapped out  is very nearly a concession in the presidential race before it s even September.Featured image via Flickr                                                                                                                                                                          
FAKE, A new report from the New York Times finds that Donald Trump owes twice as much debt as he reported on his public election filings.The NY Times reports  Beyond finding that companies owned by Mr. Trump had debts of at least $650 million  The Times Discovered that a substantial portion of his wealth is tied up in three passive partnerships that owe an additional $2 billion to a string of lenders  including those that hold the loan on the Avenue of the Americas building. If those loans were to go into default  Mr. trump might not be held personally liable  but the value of his investments would sink. The NY Times points out that Trump probably didn t lie about the amount of debt he has in his public filings  it s just a matter of the forms that were filled out not being designed for a person who has as complex financial holdings as Trump does.What s really interesting about the report  is that it also shows Trump s one of the very few criticisms of Hillary Clinton shared by some on the left  which he stole from progressives anyway  is now rendered completely invalid for him to make  due to it being completely hypocritical.The NY Times reports  An office building on Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan  of which Mr. Trump is part owner  carries a $950 million loan. Among the lenders  the Bank of China  one of the largest banks in a country that Mr. Trump has railed against as an economic foe of the United States  and Goldman Sachs  a financial institution he has said controls Hillary Clinton  the Democratic nominee  after it paid her $675 000 in speaking fees. Trump has positioned himself as a strong businessman throughout his presidential campaign. However  he has come under fire from Democrats as report after report comes out showing that he is actually a huge failure in the world of business. Most notably from Elizabeth Warren who has said that  Donald Trump is a loser. Count all his failed businesses. See how he kept his father s empire afloat by cheating people with scams like Trump University and by using strategic corporate bankruptcy  excuse me  bankruptcies  to skip out on debt. The report is damning and should give Democrats a few more talking points that show just how dangerous a Trump presidency would be for the United States.Featured image from Spencer Platt Getty Images                                                                                                                                                                          
FAKE, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is blasting the Republican obstructionism that has crippled the United States Supreme Court. Ginsburg said that having only eight justices sitting on the high court is simply  not good enough  to deal with the crucial issues at hand.Speaking to New Mexico State Bar Association members who had gathered on Friday  Ginsburg explained that the short-handed court had been faced with important decisions in recent months that were unable to be dealt with properly because the court does not have the intended number of justices.When we are evenly divided  it is equivalent to denying review   Ginsburg said.  There were important issues in these four cases that we were unable to decide  and they will come back again and one of them was the president s immigration policy.Ginsburg spoke of several recent cases that had been before the court but had resulted in 4-4 deadlock rather than a final decision  which left the ruling of lower courts in place. The cases she referenced included a key case on immigration  organized labor fees  and the ability of Native American tribal courts to decide controversies involving visitors.The Supreme Court has been operating with only eight justices rather than nine since the unexpected death of Antonin Scalia in February. Before his body had even had a chance to get cold  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that Senate Republicans would refuse to consider any nomination put forth by President Obama. So far  they have held true to their word and have refused to hold a confirmation hearing for Obama s Supreme Court nominee  Merrick Garland.Last month  Garland made history and now holds the record for the longest wait for a confirmation hearing of anyone who has ever been nominated to the Supreme Court. There is no justifiable reason that Senate Republicans have refused to give Obama s nominee a straight up or down vote. Meanwhile  the highest court in the land has been crippled by their absurd obstructionism.Featured image via Kevork Djansezian Getty Images                                                                                                                                                                          
FAKE, A pastor shamefully lied in defense of Donald Trump on Saturday and Joy Reid shut him down HARD.During an interview on MSNBC  conservative  Christian  pastor Darrell Scott  who is one of the few black people in America who support the Republican nominee  pretended that Trump is not a racist and denied that Trump had anything to do with the birther movement against President Obama.Trump tried to sell himself to black voters on Friday in front of an audience of white people by telling them they have  nothing to lose  by voting for him. That led Reid to ask   If Donald Trump makes a speech to black people when there are none around to hear it  did he make a sound? Reid turned to Scott and noted that Trump has made two appeals to black voters in recent days in places where the black population only makes up about 1 percent of the total.  Why is he making those appeals in front of almost exclusively white audiences?  she asked.Scott made excuses for Trump  claiming that it doesn t matter where he speaks because all African-Americans hear him. When pressed on why Trump has not accepted invitations from the NAACP  the Urban League  and the National Association of Black Journalists because he supposedly had better things to do already on his schedule.Reid smiled as Scott called Trump  a cultural phenomenon  who draws rock star crowds. Reid then zinged back that those crowds are devoid of black people.Reid slammed Trump for pushing the false notion that every black person in America is living in poverty and going to failing schools and then asked Scott about Trump s history of housing discrimination  which has been cited by the Justice Department because the Republican nominee refused to rent to black people.Scott claimed that it was just an accusation and denied that Trump discriminated against black people  but the record shows that Trump settled the case with the government because there was a strong case against him  hardly the action of a man who didn t commit such an offense.Reid then asked Scott about Trump s prominent role in the birther movement. Despite multiple video tapes of Trump pushing the birther conspiracy and demanding President Obama s birth certificate  Scott also denied that Trump had anything to do with the movement. Don t tell me you agree with the bitherism  sir   Reid pleaded.  Don t tell me you agree with that. Scott replied by claiming that Hillary Clinton started the birther movement  a notion that is totally false. And Reid shut Scott down for blatantly lying on her show. That s wrong. Even a pastor cannot make things up on this show   she cautioned. I respect you as a pastor  but you re not going to come on and make things up. Here s the video via MSNBC.Donald Trump is desperately trying to save his flailing campaign and that s the only reason why he is making feeble attempts to court black voters now. If he really cared about black people he would have been courting them from the beginning. Instead  he has been palling around with white supremacists and encouraging violence against black protesters at his rallies. Scott can t sit there and call himself a man of God while lying through his teeth to defend a bloated racist. It s just not going to fly.Featured image via screenshot                                                                                                                                                                          
FAKE, Donald Trump s efforts to reach out to voters of color has been going about as terrible as one might expect it to go. Kayleigh McEnany  an avid Trump supporter  took part in a panel discussion on CNN s Anderson Cooper 360   where she attempted to continue that campaign. Not surprisingly  all she did was got shut down by the black members of the panel  Bakari Sellers and Angela Rae.McEnary began the panel discussion which revolved around black issues  by shouting down the black panelists  citing statistics about black people and poverty  saying that  You might think a 27.2  poverty rate among African American individuals is a good thing but  At that point  McEnary is interrupted by Rae who insists that no one had made that claim  asking her to retract the statement.That s when the panel really began to go into melt-down. McEnery tried to position Trump as a civil rights leader who  was on the cutting edge of civil rights  because he fought for inclusiveness in his clubs. While Trump might have expanded his customer base to include black and Jewish Americans. the other panelists were not buying it for a moment that Trump was a civil rights leader.What McEnery failed to mention  but Rae didn t  is that Trump only began to allow black and Jewish Americans into his clubs after he had been sued for housing discrimination.The best moment of the panel discussion is when Rae lays her thoughts out on the matter. She does not hold back  saying  If you want Donald Trump to say something that s meaningful to black people  and I m not going to be the spokesperson for all black people tonight  but what I m going to tell you is this. Plain and simple. He can disavow his racist butler. He can apologize for those two housing discriminations from the Department of Justice. He can tell me that that Black Lives Matter protester who he said deserves to get beat up  he can retract that and apologize for that. He can tell me that he never meant to say those legal fees of that guy that punched that black man in the face at his rally  should ve happened. He can apologize for the Indian man that was thrown out of his rally today. He can apologize to the Central Park Five  Sellers interrupts to say  All five of them. for taking out that full-page ad on them   I m not done  I m just getting started and I haven t even got to last July   Rae continues.  My only point to you is this  Donald Trump doesn t just have a messaging problem. He has a message and belief problem  Kayleigh  and he has to   he has to hear it from more than Rhinestones and Polyester  his two little imps that go out on the trail for him.

FAKE, After 20 years of corruption  millions of dollars wasted in ethics charges  and a stain on the integrity of law enforcement  Sheriff Joe Arpaio will finally be facing criminal prosecution.After being found guilty in civil court for being in contempt of court  U.S. District Court Judge Murray Snow  a Republican appointee  recommended that prosecutors bring forth criminal charges against Arpaio  second-in-command Gerard Sheridan  and Maricopa County Sheriff s Office Captain Steve Bailey. Also recommended for prosecution is Arpaio s attorney  Michele Iafrate.Two months ago  Arpaio  Sheridan  Bailey and Iafrate were found guilty in civil court of violating court orders to halt a process used by the Maricopa County Sheriff s Office that included elements of racial profiling. Not only did the Office  at the behest of Arpaio  intentionally disregard the orders  those named in the civil suit lied about doing so  even while under oath.In his order  Snow  who wrote 22 times that the defendants had  intentionally  broke the law and court order  said Criminal contempt serves to vindicate the Court s authority by punishing the intentional disregard for that authority.In other words  Arpaio and his thugs aren t above the law.Congratulations  Republicans  while you all were screaming  lock her up  at the RNC  one of your keynote speakers  Mr. Arpaio himself  is being dragged into court to face criminal charges.Arpaio s legal team said they of course would be appealing the decision in civil court and challenging the recommendation for criminal charges.Even with Trump on the ticket  Arpaio is in the fight of his life to retain his seat as Sheriff of Maricopa County. After seeing his support shrink in every election since his first one   1994   Arpaio faces his toughest re-election bid yet  with multiple polls showing Democratic challenger Paul Penzone ahead in the race  something that has never happened to Arpaio  and similarly with John McCain in his race against Ann Kirkpatrick .If all goes according to plan  the voters will kick Arpaio out of office and a criminal court will finally find him guilty of abusing his power. Nothing would be better than seeing Arpaio in the pink underwear in Tent City.Featured image via Alex Wong Getty Images                                                                                                                                                                          
FAKE, Donald Trump has once again showed why he will only have white  male support. In a recent  shakeup  which entails  staying on script   the GOP nominee made his much anticipated pitch to African American voters.And just as one would expect  it went horribly  horribly wrong.Trump actually said no joking around   that black people should vote for him because they have nothing left to lose  What do you have to lose? You re living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What do you have to lose? This speech was delivered in a community   Lansing  Michigan   which is 93 percent white and less than one percent black. If Trump is serious about courting black voters and sympathizing with their struggles  he should go to Harlem  Chicago  New Orleans  Detroit  and other areas where the black population is at least above 25 percent.After telling black voters that their livelihood sucks and that they all belong in low-income socio-economic conditions  Trump made the bold prediction that he  with less than three months to go until election day  would win 95 percent of the black vote. The sheer arrogance and misguided gobbledygook espoused out of his mouth should alone be the disqualifying factor.Trump is polling at 1 percent with black voters. In less than three months  he s going to have to convince 94 percent of the black population he s  with  them. Like everything else  Trump is setting himself up for failure.The man who has been sued for housing discrimination against blacks is now all of a sudden going to be their savior  just like middle class America s? The man who pointed to a random black man and screamed  look at my African American  is the one who will  produce  for the black community?Trump missed one very key  and detrimental  point in his speech  not every black person is in poverty. Not every black person goes to a broken school. Not every black person is unemployed. The dog whistle stereotypes that Trump perpetuated were not meant to showcase black plight   it was political red meat for his racist base of support.And to answer Trump s question of  what do you have to lose?  the answer is quite simple  everything.With his candidacy breathing new life into the white nationalist movement  anybody who isn t a white  Christian male has something to lose from a Trump presidency  and that especially includes African Americans.The Clinton campaign commented swiftly on Trump s racist  offensive and misleading remarks  saying Donald Trump asks what the African American community has to lose by voting for him. The answer is everything from a man who questions the citizenship of the first African American President  courts white supremacists  and has been sued for housing discrimination against communities of color. Trump painting the entire community as living in poverty with no jobs continues to show he is completely out of touch with the African American community.Trump may have just cemented his losing streak with black voters.Featured image via Joe Readle Getty Images                                                                                                                                                                          
FAKE, You ve probably seen the headlines that Aetna  one of the largest providers in the Affordable Care Act exchanges  has pulled out. Critics of Obamacare had nothing but schadenfreude. They told us Obamacare was doomed and this was proof. As it turns out  Aetna s move was less about the viability of Obamacare  as they claimed  than about a personal and political vendetta against the President  whose administration denied a merger between Aetna and Humana.The CEO of one of the largest providers in the network thinks Aetna is completely wrong. Bernard Tyson of Kaiser Permanente thinks Obamacare has been great for his bottom line and that if Aetna was in fact losing money  it was because they were bad at managing it.Tyson does understand that it s a tough market. People have been sicker than anticipated  which makes sense. If you give millions of people who haven t been able to afford medical care medical care  it will take a few years to bring their health up to that of people who have had insurance. Congress hasn t helped either. Republicans have blocked the assistance that was being offered to the insurance companies to help with the transition.But  according to Tyson  that DOES NOT mean that Obamacare is a failure. The idea that I would turn my back on a segment of the American population who really needs the coverage and the care I m in for the long haul   Tyson said.  And I m cautiously optimistic that at some point  we begin to make sure we have the right regulations  meaning oversight  to make sure the market is behaving like it was intended. Kaiser has made a  slight margin  overall on its ACA plans  Tyson said. Centene Corp.  Molina Healthcare and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida similarly have found ways to make money on the exchanges. Narrow networks of hospital and doctors  as well as high deductibles  have worked for Medicaid plans like Centene and Molina. Florida Blue has relied on higher premiums than its peers.Source  Modern Health Care  blockquote Another problem is that the insurers themselves may be pricing themselves out of the market because of the  drum roll  free market. There were conscious decisions made in the pricing of the product when it first started that did not hold logic to the marketplace   Tyson said.  This is not rocket science. There s a pool of people to take care of  there s an underwriting process  and there were decisions made that   I m going to consciously underprice  and what I m going to do is gain market share and over time it s going to work itself out. Here s the full interview. It s quite interesting  and if you live in a Kaiser market  it might be worth supporting them Featured image via video screen capture.                                                                                                                                                                           
FAKE, What is the one thing that might actually scare Donald Trump? That s right   the prospect of releasing his tax returns has him terrified. The mere thought of making them public  just as every single presidential candidate in recent memory has done  is more abhorrent to him than his sexual obsession with his daughter is to the rest of us. But unfortunately for The Donald  he may not have a choice in the matter if Senate Democrats have their way.The Connecticut Mirror reports that Senators Chris Murphy and Ron Wyden have come up with a solution to Trump s nonsensical refusal to be honest with the American people about his taxes   something even George W. Bush was able to accomplish Partnering with fellow Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden  D-Ore.  Murphy on Thursday pressed for votes for a bill that would require all presidential candidates from major parties to make public their tax returns within two weeks of their parties  national conventions. The effort is part of a renewed Democratic campaign over Trump s tax filings.In keeping his tax returns under wraps  Murphy said Trump is violating a  40-year-standard of campaign transparency and may even be running for president to change tax laws that benefit his companies. This is an extraordinary moment in which the candidate may be seeking the presidency to protect his investments   Murphy says of his effort.What is Trump hiding?  Many people are saying  he has made substantial donations to NAMBLA   the North American Man-Boy Love Association   he does not want to become public. While this is a long-shot  as the organization is not actually tax exempt and would not show up on Trump s tax returns  it is clear that he fears their release. In any case  the  Presidential Tax Transparency Act  would let the public know all of Trump s dirty little tax secrets he desperately wants to keep hidden.In fact  it would force the FEC to post candidates  returns on the official website for all to see anytime they wish if the candidate did not voluntarily disclose them within two weeks of their party s national conventions.So far the bill only has five co-sponsors  including Tim Kaine  but the idea seems popular.Not only would this be a great idea  but it would lead to the most hilariously humiliating concession speech one can imagine.Featured image via Getty Images Brian Bianco                                                                                                                                                                          
FAKE, It s no secret that Donald Trump has a hard time with not only attracting minority voters  but also the votes of millenials that have grown up in a less racist  more diverse and accepting country than the America that Trump wants to enforce if he wins this election.But there are still young voters that are attracted to Trump  like 18-year-old Jake Anantha from Charlotte  North Carolina. Rather than be thankful for Anantha s support at a time when Trump is basically dying in the polls  the Trump campaign decided to kick this young Republican out of a rally on Thursday because he wasn t white.Jake was more than excited to attend Trump s event and give Trump his first primary vote. He was even wearing a Trump shirt to the rally  but his joy quickly left him when he was removed by police from the Charlotte Convention Center because the Trump campaign had accused him of being a protester. Jake s only  offense  was  having dark skin   according to Ramesh Anantha  Jake s father.Ramesh complained that as a young person of color  his son should have been been treated with respect   especially since Trump s rally was about supporting minorities. Ramesh  whose parents immigrated from India  said  It s unbelievably ironic  and argues that his son should have been looked at as a perfect Trump supporter. He should have been somebody they re putting up on stage. Screenshot of Jake being removed by securityAccording to the young supporter himself  this incident has changed his mind about supporting Trump  now that his campaign s true colors have shown. In an interview on Friday  Jake said that initially  he didn t mind Trump s brash campaign  When I saw him on TV  I personally didn t mind his rhetoric. I defended him. When people called him a racist  I said he s a critic of our flawed immigration system. He s strong on Islamic terrorism. Jake had gotten to the rally early and was able to get a position near the stage. He was just standing there innocently minding his own business when security tapped him on the shoulder and tried to escort him out. They said  We know who you are. You ve been at many other rallies. Jake tried to object and plea that it had been his first Trump rally and was not a protester  but police removed him anyway. The event had been private  so Trump s staff had full control over who could attend   and Jake was apparently not white enough. Forced to stay outside the Convention Center or risk being arrested  Jake watched white people enter the rally effortlessly. He said  I thought  Trump  was for all people. I don t believe he is for all people anymore. Why are all these white people allowed to attend and I m not? The Trump campaign has failed to apologize to Jake  and the young voter says that this incident has made him change his mind about Trump. He is now planning to vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson.Jake was not the only minority to be ejected from this event. Rose Hamid  a Muslim who was peacefully protesting by handing out flower pens  was also removed when Jake was taken out of the rally.

FAKE, While Republicans try to make Louisiana s deadly floods  Obama s Katrina   there is only one person getting flack for being a raging opportunist   you guessed it   Donald Trump.Louisiana s Democratic governor  John Bel Edwards  blasted the Republican nominee for president after he showed up to Louisiana for a photo opportunity. While citizens are dying and being displaced by the thousands  Trump has decided he would exploit the carnage in an attempt to undermine President Obama.Remember when President Obama was chided by the GOP for not calling Gov. Rick Scott for two days after the Orlando massacre? Well  flooding has been going on in Louisiana for a week and still  Donald Trump has not reached out to the governor or any state leader tasked with handling the crisis. A spokesman for the governor pointed out Donald Trump hasn t called the governor to inform him of his visit. We welcome him to LA but not for a photo-op. Instead we hope he ll consider volunteering or making a sizable donation to the LA Flood Relief Fund to help the victims of the storm.Trump  the self described billionaire and charitable man  should donate.While Republicans continue to bash President Obama  Edwards has gone on the record asking that President Obama not travel to Louisiana for at least a week until the state is more secure   out of respect and timeliness of those working to aid the state.Trump s newest campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the trip is  a decidedly nonpolitical event  no press allowed  going to help people on the ground who are in need. And what did Trump do as soon as she said that? He took questions from the press and said President Obama would rather play golf than help those affected in Louisiana. Even though President Obama has secured the relief funds for the state and has expressed his support and thoughts for those affected  the Trump train has decided to use the opportunity to smear him and once again make Trump look like the unsung hero of the day.So much for no media and not being political.Once again  Trump is exploiting and using people s pain for personal gain. He s done that his entire life  so why stop now.Featured image via Joshua Lott Getty Images                                                                                                                                                                          
FAKE, Donald Trump thinks his  apology  was a  great success   and he just got owned on Twitter for it.During a speech in North Carolina on Thursday  the Republican nominee claimed to  regret  some of the things he has said during his campaign. Sometimes  in the heat of the debate and speaking on a multitude of issues  you don t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that  and I regret it  particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues. But  this is Donald Trump  so of course he backtracked on that moments later. In this journey  I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe myself. I will never put anyone s interests ahead of yours. Trump then took to Twitter to tout his speech as a  great success. The reporting at the failing  nytimes gets worse and worse by the day.

FAKE, Donald Trump has made it a point of his campaign to never apologize for anything  but he poorly tried to do exactly that on Thursday and Hillary Clinton nailed him for it. Sometimes  in the heat of the debate and speaking on a multitude of issues  you don t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing   Trump told an audience in North Carolina.  I have done that  and I regret it  particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues. But then he turned around and wiped that apology away by claiming that he will never lie to his supporters and that he will will always put their interests first. In this journey  I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe myself. I will never put anyone s interests ahead of yours. But Hillary Clinton did not let the Republican nominee get away with making a false apology.Her campaign issued a statement in response and it s absolutely perfect. Donald Trump literally started his campaign by insulting people   the statement reads. He has continued to do so through each of the 428 days from then until now  without shame or regret. We learned tonight that his speechwriter and teleprompter knows he has much for which he should apologize. But that apology tonight is simply a well-written phrase until he tells us which of his many offensive  bullying and divisive comments he regrets and changes his tune altogether. The statement then goes on give a list of examples of all the groups Trump has insulted complete with citations. Then it lists Trump  past record of regret. On attacking the Khans  a Gold Star family  I don t regret anything. On assailing the ethics and motives of Judge Curiel Asked if he regretted making his criticism of the judge personal Trump said his side had been treated very unfairly.On calling immigrants rapists  No  I don t apologize. On mocking a reporter with a disability Trump denied he had mocked the reporter and demanded his own apology.This is a fake apology by Trump. He s had more than a year s worth of opportunities to sincerely apologize for the horrible things he has said but he has only doubled down. He cannot possibly expect that this one sorry excuse for an apology will cover all of the harmful words he has vomited over the last year and two months since his campaign began. Nor should he expect it to be blindly accepted.It is said that it is  better late than never  but in this case it is too late. This slate cannot be wiped clean. Trump owes a personal apology to all the people he has demeaned  threatened  and mocked.The Republican Party needs to be held accountable for making Trump their leader and Trump needs to face actual consequences for all the bullshit he has spewed. That punishment and accountability can only come in one way. Americans need to vote on Election Day in November and send a clear message to Trump and the GOP. And that means a landslide victory for Democrats.Featured image via Getty Images                                                                                                                                                                          
FAKE, Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been openly critical of Donald Trump  and of the Republican Party s continued support of the bombastic billionaire for president. Now  one of his former campaign operatives has written a stunning op-ed in which he roundly trashed Donald Trump and gave a rather glowing endorsement of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. That man is David Nierenberg  Romney s former finance chair. The piece appeared on CNBC s website. Nierenberg says of Hillary Clinton  Hillary Clinton knows her stuff. She is emotionally mature and centered. She respects and enjoys working with people from all backgrounds.She has the diplomatic skills needed to break the gridlock in Washington and lead our country well. America needs a steady hand on the tiller. Despite being a Republican with ties to Mitt Romney dating back to 2006  Nierenberg had this to say about his party s current standard-bearer  Trump is the most dangerous major party presidential candidate in my lifetime  maybe in American history. His character  temperament and behavior are definitely not presidential.I don t think he s fit to be our president. He speaks positively about foreign dictators and acts like one himself.This year  however  watching and listening to Donald Trump s erratic daily bullying  ranting  bragging  scapegoating and name-calling  my conscience and my three adult children will not let me vote for him. Nierenberg also joined the call for Trump to release his tax returns. He said  For decades  candidates  including successful business people  have released their tax returns  why does Trump think he shouldn t follow the rules of the game? Defeating him has to be our national priority. He is exactly right. This is a time to put party before country. This is no longer about left versus right  Republicans versus Democrats. This is about having one candidate in what is  for all intents and purposes  a two-party political system who is qualified versus one who is a dangerously unfit demagogue. The choice is ours  America. Put party before country and vote blue in November.Featured image via Instagram                                                                                                                                                                          
FAKE, An interracial couple in Olympia  Washington  was stabbed by a man sporting white supremacist tattoos and markings. The attacker appeared to have racist feelings and spoke out against Black Lives Matter  according to an account of his questioning by police.The accused  32-year-old Daniel Rowe  had tattoos on his body reading  skinhead    white power   and in the shape of the Confederate flag. The man in the couple he went after sustained non-life threatening injuries while the woman was grazed by his knife in the attack.Upon his arrest  Rowe allegedly told police that he had gone downtown after hearing about anti-police graffiti that had been put up Sunday night  according to court documents. He reportedly told police that if he were let go  he would head to a Donald Trump rally and stomp out more of the Black Lives Matter group. This has all the hallmarks of a hate crime   said Deputy Prosecutor Joseph Wheeler. This black-and-white couple was simply expressing their love for one another   he added.Black Lives Matter has been demonized both by conservative politicians and right-wing media like Fox News Channel  where host Bill O Reilly has compared the movement to the Ku Klux Klan.This is not the first apparent hate crime to be connected to Trump s campaign. In addition to various non-criminal incidents around the country  a Latino man in Massachusetts was beaten up by Trump fans as they cited the candidate and discussed deporting him.Trump himself has directed his rally attendees to be violent towards protesters  including those there on behalf of Black Lives Matter. Trump publicly offered to pay the legal bills for one man who punched a protester  and cheered on the idea of punching people who disrupt his events.By comparison  Hillary Clinton has said  black lives matter   and has featured mothers who have lost a child as a result of police brutality as part of her campaign as the  Mothers of the Movement.  They spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this summer.Featured image via screen capture                                                                                                                                                                          
FAKE, Jewelry designers Jill Martinelli and Sabine Le Guyader of Lady Grey in Brooklyn left Ivanka Trump a note with her recent purchase. Let s just say the two designers aren t fans of her father s. In the note  the two thanked her for her order but added that they were donating the proceeds to the American Immigration Council  the Everytown for Gun Safety organization and the Hillary Clinton campaign.The handwritten note was signed   Best  Jill   Sabine   with the Instagram photo of the letter captioned   Dear  ivankatrump   thanksbutnothanks  payitFORWARD. While we were flattered to receive an order from Ivanka Trump  our social and political views couldn t be further from those of the Trump campaign   Marinelli told The Cut.

FAKE, Katrina Pierson  Donald Trump s official campaign spokeswoman who appears to have a permanent spot in front of a cable news camera  added to her long list of bizarre claims and blatantly false lies by alleging that Hillary Clinton has a brain disease.Pierson threw out the conspiracy theory on MSNBC on Thursday evening.Speaking on MSNBC  Katrina Pierson alleged that Clinton has a disorder called dysphasia  a condition brought on by brain trauma that erodes a person s ability to speak or comprehend language. What s new are the other reports or observations of Hillary Clinton s behavior or mannerisms   as well as her dysphasia  the fact that she s fallen  she has had a concussion  there are really interesting things out there   Pierson said.The Trump campaign has been echoing conspiracy theorists like radio host Alex Jones  who believes 9 11 was an  inside job  by the government  and Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone  he thinks that LBJ had John F. Kennedy killed  for the last few months. And Trump of course was the lead spokesperson for the birther conspiracy theory that alleges that President Obama was not born in America.Along with these conspiracy theorists  right wing media outlets like the Drudge Report and Fox News  Sean Hannity have been presenting a pile of false claims that Clinton s health is weak.Months ago  her campaign released a medical assessment from Clinton s doctor and found the former Secretary of State in good health. By comparison  the Trump campaign s health document was widely ridiculed at the time  as its hyperbolic language seemed to have come from Trump himself  and not a reputable doctor.The wild theories about Clinton s health have coincided with Trump s drop in the polls  as he has plummeted to be anywhere from 4-15 percent behind Clinton nationally. He is even tied or very close to her in multiple  red  states that have been easily won by previous Republican candidates like Mitt Romney and John McCain  including Georgia  Missouri  and even Texas.So more conspiracies can be expected.Featured image via YouTube                                                                                                                                                                          
FAKE, Trump s appointment of Breitbart chief Steve Bannon  along with his decision to have at least two people at the top of his campaign who will let him run amok  has further frightened and infuriated Republicans to the point where they re finally seeing reality about the candidate they put at the top of their ticket. As the layers of their delusions continue to be peeled back  former Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber says  Look  we are in a terrible position. The Republican Party has made a mistake of historic proportion and when you do that  you find yourself in a place with no good solutions. Trump s idiocy has started to affect down-ticket races all across the country  particularly in the Senate. Senators in tight races saw their numbers drop considerably between August 3 and August 15. This is good news for Democrats  but the GOP s continued insistence that Trump will  ultimately  work for them is rapidly becoming a pipe dream.It s hard to feel sorry for them over that  though  because they re the ones who stuck themselves with a candidate who can t even run a cohesive campaign. In fact  Weber sees conniving manipulation in Trump s decision to have three people managing his campaign  We now have a CEO  a campaign chairman and a campaign manager. That tells me that no one is in charge of this campaign. Trump is playing these three people against each other. Indeed  since the campaign manager is still Paul Manafort  Trump could be playing him against the other two. When Manafort replaced Corey Lewandowski as campaign manager back in June  everyone saw it as a sign that Trump was ready to take on the mantle of campaigning for the general election. They expected a pivot  effected in part by Manafort.But he s not pivoting  and he won t. Manafort failed miserably there. Since Trump s strategy of alienation worked so well during the primaries  he can t see any reason at all to change  I am who I am. It s me. I don t want to change. Everyone talks about  oh are you gonna pivot?  I don t want to pivot. I mean you have to be you. If you start pivoting  you are not being honest with people. That s a laugh coming from the man who spreads lies as easily as people spread the common cold. It s even sillier coming from someone who s trailing so badly in the polls that he s reduced to tweeting the ones where he s only a couple of points behind Hillary.His campaign is quickly becoming the only Republican entity that s still mired in the delusion that he can win anything at all. Hell has frozen over  The GOP is starting to admit  outright  that they fucked themselves sideways with a rusty chainsaw in nominating Donald Trump for president.Featured image via Ralph Freso Getty Images
